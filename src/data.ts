All-Pro kicker Jocelyn Charette added a 36-yard field goal as San Diego built a 10-0 halftime lead. The second half belonged entirely to the Rebellion defense. San Diego's defensive front, led by star playmaker Brittani Lusain, controlled the line of scrimmage and bottled up the Legends.

Just before halftime, Rebellion quarterback Danny Trainor engineered a critical red-zone drive and capped it with a quarterback keeper to extend the lead to 10-0. The defining moment came early in the second half when Katie Claxton stepped in front of a Falconz pass and returned it for a Pick-9, extending the lead to 20-0. The Rebellion defense, led by defensive lineman Sabrina Kessler and linebacker duo Brittani Lusain and Katie Claxton, consistently disrupted the Falconz's triple option rhythm.
